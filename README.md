# **Code Challenge: Loops**

**Instructions**

1. Clone down this assignment to your `tip-challenges` directory in your environment.
2. Code your solutions using JavaScript in `index.js`.
3. **Be sure to run and test your code thoroughly.**
4. By the end of class, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on GitHub.

## example.js

This function `staircaseSum` demonstrates how to use a **loop** to **accumulate a total**.

- The `for` loop runs from `1` to `n`, adding each number to the `total`.
- It shows how loops can **reduce repetition** by performing the same operation multiple times.
- Finally, the function **returns the sum** of all numbers from `1` to `n`.

**Example:**

`staircaseSum(5)` adds `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5` and returns `15`.

## **Index.js**

Write a function that prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using **only variables and a loop** — no arrays needed.

**Example:**

```jsx
printFibonacci(5);  // should print 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
printFibonacci(10); // should print 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```
