## example.js

This function `staircaseSum` demonstrates how to use a **loop** to **accumulate a total**.

- The `for` loop runs from `1` to `n`, adding each number to the `total`.
- It shows how loops can **reduce repetition** by performing the same operation multiple times.
- Finally, the function **returns the sum** of all numbers from `1` to `n`.

**Example:**

```jsx
staircaseSum(5) // adds 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 and returns 15
```

## **Index.js**

**Problem: Sum of Square Numbers**

Write a function that prints the first `n` square numbers and also calculates the sum of these numbers.

A **square number** is the product of a number multiplied by itself. For example:

- 1 × 1 = 1
- 2 × 2 = 4
- 3 × 3 = 9

**Example**

```jsx
printSquareNumbers(5);
//will print:
// 1
// 4
// 9
// 16
// 25
// Final output is: 55
```
