3. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
4. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
5. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
6. Using the browser, verify that your code was pushed by checking this remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countToFifty` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 50. 
```
countToFifty() //1,2,3,4...49,50
```

2. Write a function named `countFromOne` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers from 1 up to the given integer. 
```
countFromOne(7) //1,2,3,4,5,6,7
```

3. Write a function named `countFromN` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers from the given integer to 1. 
```
countFromN(7) //7,6,5,4,3,2,1
```

4. Write a function named `threeOrFiveInFifty` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 3 or 5.
```
threeOrFiveInFifty() //3,5,6,9,10,12...45,48,50
```

5. Write a function named `threeOrFive` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers that are divisible by 3 or 5.
```
threeOrFive(20) //3,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,20
```

#### Bonus

6. Write a function named `triple` that takes in an array of integers and returns a new array of integers with triple their value.
```
triple([1, 2, 3]) // returns [3,6,9]
triple([5, 20, 27, 36,]) // returns [15, 60, 81, 108]
```
